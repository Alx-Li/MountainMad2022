# Mountain Madness 2022 - Let's Eat, Grandma!

### Who doesn't love their cooking with their grandma. "Let's Eat, Grandma!" is a full stack web app built on Next.js and MongoDB using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for you to share your favourite recipies with your grandma. View other people's recipes and see their amazing dishes in the recipes tab or even upload your own via our immersive recipe creation process!
 
 
Ambiguity- The comma has an important role in the understanding of our app title; is it "Let's eat, grandma", showcasing the different recipes loved by grandmothers, or is it "Let's Eat Grandma", an eerily cannibalist forum? I guess you'll have to see it for yourself and find out!

The Rubey- Seeing the intuitive and simple process of adding recipes, we believe that the app deserves such a renowned title of innovation.
